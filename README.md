# Next.js Project Accelerated Launch Guide

Supercharge your Next.js project with this cutting-edge template bootstrapped using `create-next-app`.

## Dive into Action

1. **Ignite the Development Server**

   Launch the development server with your preferred package manager:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Witness your project come to life by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

2. **Craft Your Digital Masterpiece**

   Embark on your creative journey by personalizing the default page. Empower your ideas by crafting changes in `pages/index.tsx`. Marvel at how your page evolves in real-time as you sculpt it.

3. **Unleash API Wizardry**

   Command API routes with the flair of a wizard! Explore the mystical realms of API endpoints at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). Mold this magical endpoint into your own creation by weaving your spells within the `pages/api/hello.ts` file. Remember, the `pages/api` directory is your cauldron for brewing API routes, not just React pages.

4. **Font Alchemy**

   This project employs the powerful `next/font` sorcery to automatically optimize and conjure the Inter font, a bespoke Google Font experience.
