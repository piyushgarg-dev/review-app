Review App is a web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It simplifies the process of adding a review system to your website. Instead of creating a whole new backend for the review system, you can create a review application on Review App and easily integrate it into your website.

With Review App, you can gather valuable feedback and reviews from your website's users. Whether you run an e-commerce site, a blog, or any other online platform, adding a review feature can help you build trust and improve user engagement.
