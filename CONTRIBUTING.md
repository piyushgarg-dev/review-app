# Setting Up the Development Environment

## Frontend

To set up the development environment locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the frontend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/review-app.git
   cd review-app
   ```

2. Install project dependencies using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install

3. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of the frontend project and add the following environment variables:

   You can also find similar environment variables in `.env.example`.
